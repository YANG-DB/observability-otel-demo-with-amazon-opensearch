## OpenSearch OpenTelemetry Observability Demo with Amazon Services Workshop
Amazon OpenSearch Serviceâ€™s Observability functionality allows you to go beyond simple monitoring to understand not just what events are happening, but why they are happening.
During this workshop, youâ€™ll learn how to instrument, collect, and analyze metrics, traces, and log data all the way from user front end applications and components to backend applications and services and everything in between.
