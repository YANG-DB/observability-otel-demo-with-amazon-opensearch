# AWS Setup
Before starting this Observability with Amazon OpenSearch Service Workshop, you need to create a few AWS resources. In this section, you configure those required AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation and then you work on the labs.

If you've already signed up for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and have a user with Administrator access, you can move on to complete [CloudFormation Template](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/1abb648b-2ef8-442c-a731-efbcb69c1e1e/en-US/020-getting-started/02-aws-owner-account/03-cloudformation).

If you haven't signed up for an AWS account yet, or if you need assistance, complete the following tasks to set up your AWS account for the workshop:

### [Sign Up for AWS]()
